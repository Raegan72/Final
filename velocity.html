        <h2>What is Velocity?</h2>
        <p>
            Velocity is another key element of Doppler radar and plays a crucial role in tracking storm movement and identifying severe weather conditions, especially tornadoes and high winds. Velocity measures the speed and direction of particles in the atmosphere, mainly focusing on the wind. This is critical for understanding storm rotation, movement, and wind shear.
        </p>
        <p>
            The data is gathered through the Doppler effect, which describes how the frequency of a wave changes when an object moves toward or away from the radar. When raindrops or wind move toward the radar, the frequency increases (a shift toward higher frequencies). When they move away from the radar, the frequency decreases (a shift toward lower frequencies). By measuring these shifts, Doppler radar can detect the speed and direction of winds in a storm.

            Velocity data is also color-coded:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Green areas represent winds moving toward the radar.</li>
            <li>Red areas represent winds moving away from the radar.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Strong contrasts between green and red areas are especially important. These areas, known as velocity shear, can indicate rotating winds, which are often a sign of severe weather conditions like tornadoes. Meteorologists watch these changes closely to determine if a storm is likely to produce a tornado or if it poses a danger to surrounding areas. Velocity data is essential for forecasting wind patterns, tracking storm movement, and issuing alerts for dangerous weather events.
