            <h2>Understanding Correlation Coefficient in Doppler Radar</h2>
            <p>
                The <strong>correlation coefficient (CC)</strong> is an important feature of Doppler radar that helps meteorologists separate precipitation from other objects in the atmosphere. It compares the consistency of radar returns across different locations, helping to distinguish between regular precipitation and more unusual objects, like debris from a tornado, birds, or insects.
            </p>

            <p>
                When radar returns show a consistent pattern (such as uniform-sized raindrops), the correlation coefficient is high, close to 1.0. When the returns are inconsistent, it suggests the presence of irregular or mixed-sized objects, leading to a lower correlation coefficient. This is especially important for detecting tornadoes and distinguishing debris from the actual precipitation.
            </p>

            <h3>Color-Coded Correlation Coefficient</h3>
            <p>The CC data is color-coded to help meteorologists interpret the data more easily:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>High correlation (close to 1.0)</strong> indicates typical precipitation, like rain or snow.</li>
                <li><strong>Low correlation (far below 1.0)</strong> suggests the presence of unusual objects, like debris, birds, or insects.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Meteorologists use this information to confirm the presence of a tornado and its severity. Low correlation values are often seen in areas affected by tornadoes, where debris from damaged structures or trees is lifted into the air. CC data can help meteorologists determine whether a storm is likely to produce dangerous tornadoes and how to issue warnings in a timely manner.

<p>On December 9th, 2023, a tornado near Hendersonville, TN, caused significant damage. The correlation coefficient (CC) data helped confirm the presence of the tornado by showing areas of low CC (blue), which indicated debris being picked up by the storm. This low CC signal, surrounded by high CC (red), is a clear sign that a tornado was active, even if it was rain-wrapped and hard to see on radar. This data allowed meteorologists to issue warnings quickly, helping protect the community.</p>
